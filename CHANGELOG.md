# Changelog

All notable changes to Open Synth are documented here.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-07-25

The "static" hotfix. Three compounding audio bugs that produced noise/drone under presets — most audibly a harsh static behind the Grand Piano.

### Fixed
- **Filter explosion (the static):** the Chamberlin SVF went unstable above sr/6 (8kHz @ 48kHz). Any preset with cutoff > 8kHz (piano @ 12kHz) drove the filter into runaway feedback, railing the mix into square-wave noise. Replaced with a TPT (Zavalishin) SVF — stable up to Nyquist.
- **Voice envelopes ignored presets:** `noteOn` never copied the part's envelope into the voice, so every voice used default sustain 0.8 and droned under the decaying samples. Envelopes (amp/filter/pitch + curves) now sync from each voice's part every block — covers direct, arpeggiator, and queue-triggered notes, plus live parameter edits.
- **Mix clipping:** raw voice accumulation (up to ±8 at full polyphony) slammed the tanh limiter. Added 1/√N polyphonic headroom scaling and a 0.85 sample-layer trim.
- **Acoustic preset envelopes:** piano, upright, guitars, and basses had pad-style envelopes (sustain 0.6–0.7) that droned beneath the samples. Now sustain 0–0.15 with instrument-natural decays (piano 2400ms). All 5,600 presets regenerated.

### Added
- `engine_render_test`: headless full-engine render harness (layer isolation modes, RMS/peak profiling, WAV dump) — the tool that found all of the above.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-07-25

**The C++ Rewrite.** The engine was rebuilt from the Flutter/Dart prototype (v1.1.0 and earlier) into a native JUCE 8 + C++20 application: sub-10ms latency, 16-part multitimbrality, full MFX chain, and a streaming sample ROMpler. Standalone + VST3 + CLAP.

### Sound Engine
- Dual oscillators per part — sine, saw, square, triangle, pulse, noise, wavetable
- Wavetable synthesis with 100+ built-in tables and morphing
- Physical modeling mode (body resonance, key click, sympathetic strings)
- Unison voices with detune and stereo spread; FM on both oscillators; sub-oscillator
- Multi-mode filter (lowpass, highpass, bandpass, notch, comb)
- 3 envelopes (amp with delay/hold, filter with key tracking, pitch) with per-stage curves
- 2 LFOs per part — tempo-syncable, fade-in, routable to pitch/filter/amp/pan
- Arpeggiator with 8 patterns, octave range, swing, gate, hold
- 16-part multitimbrality with full MIDI channel separation
- Drum kit with 8 preset kits and a rhythm pattern player (29 patterns across 9 categories, including Afrobeat and Reggae)

### Sample Engine (ROMpler)
- Streaming sample player with cubic interpolation, per-voice anti-aliasing, ADSR, pitch bend
- Multi-zone multisample manifests with velocity layers, round-robin, release samples, loop crossfades
- Supports both multi-layer and flat manifest formats with robust sample path resolution
- 8 CC0 sample libraries wired in as git submodules (1,419 zones): 2 pianos, 2 drum kits, 2 basses, 2 guitars

### Effects
- 5-slot FX engine (3 MFX + Reverb + Chorus, Juno-Di parity) with 60+ processor types

### Presets
- 5,600 factory presets across 20+ categories (generated library with per-category synthesis profiles)
- User preset manager with categories; setlist mode for live performance

### App
- Standalone, VST3, and CLAP builds (desktop); synthwave '84 UI
- Real-time stereo oscilloscope, zone editor overlay, phrase sampler, audio recording
- MIDI learn on all parameters, app state persistence, CPU load meter

### Fixed for 1.0.0
- **Sample manifests silently failed to load** — loader only understood the multi-layer format; all 8 shipped manifests use the flat format. The entire ROMpler layer is now functional and test-verified.
- **MIDI CC 123 (All Notes Off) left sample voices hanging** — sample player now releases; added CC 120 (All Sound Off) instant kill wired through the engine and MIDI wrapper
- ADSR attack test contaminated by prior voices' release tails — new `allSoundOff()` gives clean scenario isolation
- `native/oboe` stale gitlink broke `git submodule update --init` (and fresh `--recurse-submodules` clones)
- Cabinet simulator potential uninitialized values on out-of-range/NaN parameters
- Member initialization order mismatch in the plugin editor (`-Wreorder`, UB-class)
- Constructor parameter shadowing JUCE `AudioProcessorEditor::processor`
- Afrobeat and Reggae rhythm patterns implemented but unreachable — now in the library

### Build & Tooling
- JUCE located via `-DJUCE_DIR`, `JUCE_DIR` env var, `libs/JUCE` submodule, or `~/.juce` — no more hardcoded absolute paths
- Wired `fx_tests` (1,021 assertions) and `sample_static_test` into CMake; all test targets get FLAC support
- Generated preset library header silences expected conversion warnings via diagnostic pragmas (122k → ~800 warnings)
- Removed legacy Flutter/FFI-era dead code (`lib/`, `native/`, PortAudio/Oboe FFI sources)
- Tests: 83/83 sample decode, block processing + ADSR + pitch bend, 8/8 manifest renders, 1,021 FX assertions
